# RexSpec

Executable specifications for any system with an API (HTTP/GraphQL/Events/Whatever)

*Source file*: plain old JSON (YAML?)

*An app*: parses the JSON into pretty things to display. The pretty things are interactive. When you change them, the 
app saves the changes.

*A runner*: runs the tests and generates even prettier things to display
