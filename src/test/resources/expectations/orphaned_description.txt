<h1>Tables Define Tests</h1>
  <p>Text like this is nice but decorative: it doesn't get executed. Living documents are forced to stay up-to-date, because your tests fail if they are wrong.</p>
  <p>Things to note: <br>
   * The first cell, in the table header, defines the type of test <br>
   * The column headers are parsed for correctness (and the order matters) <br>
   * Each row consists of inputs and expected outputs <br>
   * Each row results in an API call <br>
   * The API call returns a result, which is written back into the output document</p>
