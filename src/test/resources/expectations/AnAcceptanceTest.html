  <h1>Tables Define Tests</h1>
  <p>Text like this is nice but decorative: it doesn't get executed. That means it isn't part of the living document*. Less is more.</p>
  <p>* A living document is one that stays up-to-date, instead of becoming irrelevant almost as soon as the first line of code is written (which is the fate of most documents)</p> Things to note:
  <ul>
   <li>The first cell, in the table header, defines the type of test</li>
   <li>The column headers are parsed for correctness (and the order matters)</li>
   <li>Each row consists of inputs and expected outputs</li>
   <li>Each row results in an API call</li>
   <li>The API call returns a result, which is written back into the output document</li>
  </ul>
