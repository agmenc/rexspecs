<h1>Tables Define Tests</h1>
<p>
    Text like this is nice but decorative: it doesn't get executed. Living documents are forced to stay up-to-date,
    because your tests fail if they are wrong.
</p>
<p>
    Things to note: <br/>
    * The first cell, in the table header, defines the type of test <br/>
    * The column headers are parsed for correctness (and the order matters) <br/>
    * Each row consists of inputs and expected outputs <br/>
    * Each row results in an API call <br/>
    * The API call returns a result, which is written back into the output document
